# Question

As a general rule of thumb, this issue tracker **IS NOT** for questions. **Please** do not create an issue to ask a question. If you are having issues with your sumologic-logger logs this issue tracker is not the right place for that. We'd highly recommend thoroughly reading the documentation before starting, and if you can't figure it out from there, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sumologic-logger) would be a good place to start (make sure to tag your question with sumologic-logger).
